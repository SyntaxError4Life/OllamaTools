# Ollama Python Client - Streaming and Function Calling

This project aims to address a gap in the use of the Ollama Python client by enabling both **streaming** and **function calling**. Currently, these two features cannot be used simultaneously natively.

## Objective

The main goal is to provide an overlay for the Ollama Python client that allows:
- **Streaming**: Receive model responses progressively.
- **Function Calling**: Use tool calls to interact with the model.

This solution is designed to be compatible with any model hosted on an Ollama server, offering increased flexibility.

## Advantages
- **Simplicity**: A lightweight overlay that integrates easily with the existing client.
- **Compatibility**: Works with any Ollama-compatible model.
- **Flexibility**: Enables the use of streaming and tool calls at the same time.
